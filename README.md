Voices of Lifers Main Theme
===

Utilizing the power of '_s' or 'underscores' (http://underscores.me), I was able to create a WordPress theme specific to the fellas wants and needs. The site is coded with minminal CSS, responsive, and eye-catching.

It has been emphasized to use version control, so here it is. I am also experimenting with LESS and Gulp. Bare with me, as I'm about to blow my own mind using modern tools for a modern website.
